This repository and its accompanying dynamic document and Shiny app are
three key components of the Institute for Dewormingâ€™s study on the costs
and benefits of mass deworming interventions in various settings.
Together, these materials create a transparent and reproducible analysis
to facilitate collaboration and discussion about deworming policy.

1 - [An interactive plot](https://petez.shinyapps.io/shiny_app/), which
summarizes the interactions between all key parameters for a given set
of assumptions. Materials can be found in:
[`code/shiny_app`](https://github.com/advocacy-policy-analysis/pa-dw-yes-opaque-link/tree/master/code/shiny_app).

2 - Open policy report in the form of a [dynamic
document](https://advocacy-policy-analysis.github.io/pa-dw-yes-opaque-link/),
which details all data, code, and assumptions included in the analysis.
Materials can be found in:
[`code/dynamic_doc`](https://github.com/advocacy-policy-analysis/pa-dw-yes-opaque-link/blob/master/code/01_final_opa.Rmd).

3 - This Github repository, which stores all data, code, and materials
necessary to replicate the analysis in full with minimal effort.
